## Build Instructions

  1. Download and install the latest version of Lazarus from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/files/latest/download).
  2. Run Lazarus and click on `Project->Open Project`.  Select
`eXgineer.lpi` from the `Y eXgineer` folder as the project.
  3. Click on `Run->Build` or press <kbd>SHIFT+F9</kbd>.
      * If you want to run or debug from the IDE on Windows you will need to run
        Lazarus as administrator.


## Contributing

If you wish to contribute:
  1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
  2. Create a branch for your changes.
      * Lazarus likes to make changes to files when you open
        them or move something around, so make sure you only stage the changes that
        are required for what you are trying to accomplish.
  3. Push your branch to your personal fork.
  4. Go to the original Y eXgineer repository and create a pull request:
      * Click on `compare across forks` and select your fork as the head fork and your new
        branch.
